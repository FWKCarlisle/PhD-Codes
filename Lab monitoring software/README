This file is a copy of some of matts code for sensors and lakeshore stuff from Tyler's one drive. 
The two main codes are plot_T_onscreen and temp_on_screen which connect the lakeshore cryostat to
the LT computer allowing the temps to be read directly off there. They were turned into .exe using PyInstaller.
Can be done by using the command "Python -m PyInstaller --onefile Plot_temp.py" while in the downloads directory/wherever
it's ended up.

TBH not sure what the others are doing just yet.
