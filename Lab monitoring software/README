This file is a copy of some of matts code for sensors and lakeshore stuff from Tyler's one drive. 
The two main codes are plot_T_onscreen and temp_on_screen which connect the lakeshore cryostat to
the LT computer allowing the temps to be read directly off there. 

TBH not sure what the others are doing just yet.
